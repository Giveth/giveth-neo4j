        }
        
        SEMANTIC SEARCH REQUIREMENTS:
        
        You must use semantic vector search with these exact requirements:
        
        1. Base your query on this pattern:
        ```
        MATCH (p:Project)-[:HAS_CHUNK]->(c:Chunk)
        WHERE c.embedding IS NOT NULL
        WITH p, c, gds.similarity.cosine(c.embedding, $queryVector) AS similarity
        WHERE similarity > 0.7
        WITH p, c, similarity
        ORDER BY similarity DESC
        WITH p, collect({text: c.text, similarity: similarity}) AS chunk_matches
        WHERE size(chunk_matches) > 0
        WITH p, [match IN chunk_matches | match.text] AS chunk_texts
        WHERE p.listed = true
        ```
        
        2. $queryVector will contain the embedding for: "projects impacting kids' health"
        
        3. Additional instructions:
        - NO text-based matching (CONTAINS, regex) as primary filtering
        - Adjust similarity threshold (0.7-0.85) based on query specificity
        - Always include `p.listed = true`
        - For topic queries like "kids health", add secondary filters after semantic match if needed
        - Include all requested fields in RETURN
        - Add LIMIT 20 unless otherwise specified
        - Order by similarity first, then by relevance indicators
        
        
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the Cypher query without ANY explanation, commentary, or markdown formatting. 
        The output should begin directly with a Cypher keyword like MATCH, WITH, or CALL.
        DO NOT include any headings, code blocks, or other text - JUST the raw Cypher query.
